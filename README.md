## 🧑‍🍳 What is Cooksy?

Cooksy is a chat-based AI assistant that helps you find recipes based on:

- 🍽️ A dish you're craving  
- 🥕 Ingredients you already have in your kitchen

Just type a message like *"I have chicken and rice"* or *"Find pasta recipes"* and Cooksy will guide you toward the best matching options using the Spoonacular API.

> ✨ **Coming Soon**: You'll also be able to view full recipe details and cook along with step-by-step guidance
